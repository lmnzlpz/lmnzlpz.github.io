            How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. <br>
            I love thee to the depth and breadth and height<br>
            My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight<br>
            For the ends of being and ideal grace.<br>
            I love thee to the level of every day’s<br>
            Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.<br>
            I love thee freely, as men strive for right.<br>
            I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.<br>
            I love thee with the passion put to use<br>
            In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.<br>
            I love thee with a love I seemed to lose<br>
            With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,<br>
            Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,<br>
            I shall but love thee better after death.<br>
